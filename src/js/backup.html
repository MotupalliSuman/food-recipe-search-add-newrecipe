    <li class="notetxt">
    <p>Please note that insecure products, solutions, and services lead to exposure to threats and cyber security breaches which affects procuring entities. Assuring cyber security as a feature of products and services require ensuring cyber security compliances as a part of procurement This will also help in building a cyber-security culture. Building awareness in government agencies to adopt cyber security controls as part of the procurement of ICT products and services, as well as engaging industry to put cyber security control requirements into practise, is crucial for meeting the objective of ensuring cyber security.</p>
    <p>It is noted that many times due to lack of awareness various clauses, provisions, and guidelines regarding cyber security requirements mandated by MeitY are not being incorporated while making procurements by buyer organisations. In order to give inputs to the procuring authorities regarding these aspects, Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) drafted a discussion paper regarding cyber security control matrix for the procurement of services and solutions by government organisations. The control matrix includes governance and policy, confidentiality, availability, regulatory complexity, audits and situational awareness, data security, application security, and network security. Discussion paper indicates the specification and requirements of different controls as well as indicative methods for verification for each control matrix. A copy of the discussion paper is enclosed herewith.</p>
    <p><a href="https://assets-bg.gem.gov.in/resources/upload/shared_doc/CYBER%20SECURITY%20CONTROL%20MATRIX.pdf" target="_blank">All the organisations making procurement through GeM are hereby requested to take note of the discussion paper drafted by CERT-In on "Cyber Security Controls Matrix for Procurement of Services and Solutions by Government Organisations ". which is enclosed as Annexure. </a></p>
    <p>It may be noted that procuring entities may select and include appropriate and applicable controls from the control matrix indicated in the discussion paper as a part of their procurement of ICT services and solutions. Procuring entities may also consider adding additional specific controls as per their risk profile and scope of services.</p>
    <p>It may also be noted that the adoption of cyber security controls by procuring entities in the procurement process may be kept voluntary (as best practises). However, after a year, based on the outcomes, learning control may be mandated as a part of all ICT-related procurement by government entities.</p>
    <p>All buyer organization as well as seller/service providers are requested to note the above.</p>

    <p><strong>Load Based Bidding</strong></p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <li class="notetxt">
    <p>Bids are currently being evaluated on GeM based on the price quoted by the bidder at the time of bid participation. However, there are some use cases when the buyer publishes a bid and expects certain technical and commercial parameters to be used to evaluate the price, resulting in the evaluated price being different from the bidder's offered price.</p>
    <p>To capture detailed technical and commercial parameters, GeM has added another feature whereby a buyer can declare the Technical and Commercial Loading Criteria for Bid Evaluation during Bid Creation itself, which will be printed for the bidders' reference in the Bid document.</p>
    <p>The selection of the Techno Commercial for Bid Evaluation will be optional for the buyer and the same can be saved as "No," if buyer doesn&rsquo;t wish to go with the same.</p>
    <p>This will be used by the buyer for the limited categories available in the GeM marketplace.</p>
    <p>Categories where Load based will be applicable - BIOMASS and types of pumps like HSD, Screw , Fuel, Petrol pump.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="notetxt">
    <p>Bunching of predefined categories has been enabled now for bidding. Buyer can create bunch bid of items from same category. Buyer can also create bunch bid of items from different categories if such categories are enabled for bunching by GeM. If the item categories that you are trying to bunch are not enabled to be bunched together and you feel that these are items are having same Supplier / OEM base and are required to be bought together and bunching will not lead to restriction in competition, then you may please send an email request to GeM at <a href="mailto:request-bunch@gem.gov.in"> request-bunch@gem.gov.in for enabling bunching of such categories. Please mention exact name of GeM categories that you are requesting for enabling bunching. Your request would be examined by GeM team and if it is found that such bunching would not lead to restrictive bidding, GeM would enable bunching of those categories. This is a one time exercise and once enabled, all buyers can bunch those categories in all their future bids. Custom and BoQ items are by default enabled to be bunched with other regular categories. </a></p>

    <p><strong>"Buyer Selected Non-Golden Parameters are now mandatory Bid requirement&rdquo; - Buyers can now choose both Golden and Non-Golden Parameters for defining the Bid Requirements. This will enable Buyers to impose a non-golden parameter as a mandatory specification for their Bids. </strong></p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
    <li class="notetxt">
    <p>All Golden parameters of the category and only those non-Golden parameters which Buyer has selected while creating bid (with values as selected by the Buyer or better than that), will now form part of the overall item specifications in Bid and will be published in the Bid document. Please note that the Non-Golden Parameters which are not specifically selected by the Buyer will now be discarded from bid and will not be published in bid and Sellers can offer a product with any of the allowed values for such non-golden parameters. If buyer want to make any non-golden parameter a part of bid, he must select that parameter and select its allowed values while creating bid, else GeM system would presume that buyer has no specific choice for that parameter and will accept any value for that parameter. No bid can then be rejected for such non selected parameter.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="notetxt">
    <p>It is also to be noted that the values of the reference product are no longer part of the bid and only allowed values will be part of bid. For Golden parameters, by default GeM would incorporate all values that are better than the reference product's values in the bid. Buyer can select and allow any more values that he feels appropriate so that the bid is as generic as possible to attract maximum competition. Similarly for Buyer chosen non-golden parameters also, reference product's value and better values would be allowed by default and Buyer can add more values of his choice.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="notetxt">
    <p>Sellers would now need to mandatorily comply with complete Bid specifications to proceed with Bid participation. Since bidders will now be pre-filtered and allowed to offer only those products which are matching with allowed values of Golden as well as non-Golden parameters (Buyer selected), there would now be no need for Buyer's to check or reject any bid on the ground of specification mis-match as far as GeM catalogues are concerned.</p>

    <li class="notetxt">
    <p><strong>Proof of Delivery Submission</strong></p>
    <p>The system would not allow the seller to generate an invoice, if the delivery period of an order has passed. The sellers must also submit the proof of their delivery to the consignee's location before the delivery date of the orders has passed, for their shipments to be eligible for Auto PRC and Auto CRAC</p>
    </li>
    <li class="notetxt">
    <p><strong>Auto PRC and Auto CRAC</strong></p>
    <p style="text-decoration: underline;">Auto PRC</p>
    <p>In case if the seller has submitted the proof of delivery before the order's delivery date has passed, their shipments would be eligible for auto PRC. This means that if the consignee does not generate the PRC within 4 days from the date of delivery as per the proof of delivery submitted by the seller, then the system would generate an auto PRC, marking all the shipped quantities as PRC accepted. At this point, the consignee would have 2 more days to make any modifications. In case, if still no action has been taken by the consignee within these 2 days, then this system generated auto PRC would be considered as the final PRC which could no longer be modified.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="notetxt">
    <p style="text-decoration: underline;">Auto CRAC</p>
    <p>In case if the seller has submitted the proof of delivery before the order's delivery date has passed and the final PRC is also completed (through the system or by the consignee), then their shipments would be eligible for auto CRAC. This means that if the consignee has not generated the CRAC within 10 days from the date of delivery as per the proof of delivery submitted by the seller, then the system would generate an auto CRAC, marking all the PRC quantities as CRAC accepted. At this point, the consignee would have 3 more days to make any modifications. In case, if still no action has been taken by the consignee within these 3 days, then this system generated auto CRAC would be considered as the final CRAC which could no longer be modified.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="notetxt">
    <p><strong>Supplementary Invoice</strong></p>
    <p>For product orders where the consignee has made some rejections at the PRC or CRAC stage, the sellers would now have an option to issue a supplementary invoice against these rejected quantities. This option would be available to the seller before the delivery date of the order has passed.</p>
